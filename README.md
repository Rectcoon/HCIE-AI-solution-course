## HCIE-AI-solution-course
Follow me and join me in learning the HCIE AI Solution certification!!
# 
Here's how it all started: I joined a challenge bet, where the stakes are to obtain the HCIE-AI solution certification within one month. 

I plan to prepare a comprehensive self-study resource library specifically for the HCIE-AI Solutions exam, hoping it will be effective (otherwise, I'll have to face the consequences). 

	Core mission: Conquer HCIE-AI within 30 days.
# Moving forward, I will try to include the following:
1.No-nonsense theory guide

	Distilled key exam knowledge, such as LLM optimization, Ascend chips, ModelArts architecture, etc.
2.Practical and verifiable experiments

	Replicable experiments simulating the real exam environment (ModelArts + MindSpore)
